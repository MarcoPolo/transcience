## Usage

**Works best in Chrome. It runs in FF, but the mouse events don't work**

```bash
lein run
```
__If you get the "can't recur here" error:__

For some reason on second run the cljs compiler gets AOT compiled and screws everything up. If you get an error when you run, simply

```bash
rm -rf classes/cljs/
```
